# vCardManagement


This is a beginner project in java using the library "ezVcard" (give it a look: <a href="https://github.com/mangstadt/ez-vcard">here</a>). 


First, a vcf file is a "vCard" that contain multiple profils. Each of them have their own informations.

What can you do ?


-Upload or export your vcf files

-Create one (limited options because they are too many)

-Modify profils from a vCard by updating existing information or adding new ones to it.

-Delete vCard and/or profil's vCard


I did some testing along the way on my own but bugs and logic misconception can (will certainy) occure !
