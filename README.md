# vCardManagement


This is a beginner project in java using the library "ezVcard" (give it a look: <a href="https://github.com/mangstadt/ez-vcard">here</a>). 


First, a vcf file is a "vCard" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard">wikipedia</a>) that contain multiple profils. Each one of them having their own informations (ie name, phones, emails, hobbies ...).

What can you do ?


-Upload or export your vcf files

-Create one (limited options because they are too many)

-Modify profils from a vCard by updating existing information or adding new ones to it.

-Delete vCard and/or profil's vCard


I did some testing along the way on my own but bugs and logic misconception can (will certainy) occure !

Known problems:
-too many windows...
-...causing too much clics
-bad architecture
-...
